# POA network - Proof of Physical Address (PoPA)

## Identity DApps
In POA Network, identity of individual validators plays a major role for selected consensus. We propose additional checks of identity, performed in a decentralized way. Proof of Identity DApps is a series of decentralized applications focused on connecting a user's identity to his/her wallet. Applications can be run on any Ethereum-compatible network.

## Proof of Physical Address (PoPA)
Using Proof of Physical Address, a user can confirm his/her physical address. It can be used to prove connection between residency and a network address (wallet).
User submits a form with his physical address details (name, state, city, etc) on DApp main page. This data is added to the PoPA contract deployed to the network and thus a correspondence between a wallet and physical address is registered in the contract. However, this correspondence is not yet verified.

To verify the address server sends a postcard (via post office) with confirmation code to the registered physical address. Confirmation code is used by the user to call one of contract's methods (via DApp confirmation page) to verify the correspondence between the confirmation code and the wallet used initially to register the physical address.

## How to test the current version locally
1. clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-popa.git
```

2. make sure you have node.js version >= 6.9.1 installed

3. install Ganache CLI globally
```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

4. cd to the repo folder and install dependencies.
```
cd poa-popa
npm install
```

4. sensitive data (like lob api key) can be provided by creating `web-dapp/server-config-private.js` file that exports config object like so:
```
'use strict';

module.exports = function (cfg_public) {
    return {
        lob_api_key: '******************************',
        rpc: '******************************',
        signer: '0x****************************', // with 0x prefix
        signer_private_key: '******************************', // without 0x prefix
        confirmation_page_url: '******************************',
    };
};

```
If this file is present, its keys will add to/replace keys in `web-dapp/server-config.js`.

5. open new tab in your terminal, and start testrpc with a set of predefined acounts
```
npm run start-testrpc
```
leave this tab opened until your test is complete.

6. in the first tab of your terminal deploy the contract
```
npm run deploy-on-test
```
answer `yes` when confirmation appears.

7. then to compile react components and start dapp, run:
```
npm start
```
wait until a build is ready and `Listening on 3000` is printed in terminal

8. open file `scripts/start_rpc.sh` in text editor and import one of the accounts from there to MetaMask using its private key. You can choose any address-private-key pair except `0xdbde11e51b9fcc9c455de9af89729cf37d835156` which is reserved for contract's owner.

9. navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser and do tests.

To find out confirmation code, look for a line like
```
[prepareRegTx] confirmation confirmation_code_plain: y8t44s8yrt
```
in server logs

To find response details from Lob, including links to the postcard, look for a line like
```
[notifyRegTx] postcard: {"id":"psc_106fe1363e5b9521", ..., "to": ..., thumbnails": ... }
```
in server logs

### Running tests on test network:
1. make sure you have truffle installed
```
npm install -g truffle
```
2. switch to `blockchain` folder
3. run tests
```
truffle test
```

### Running javascript tests:
1. run the test script
```
npm run test
```

2. if you want to run linter test,
```
npm run lint
```

Note: Before to run the `npm install` script it will copy a `pre-push` hook to the `.git` folder, so, before to each `git push`, it will run the tests

## How to deploy to a real network
1. download the latest version from master branch
```
git clone https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-popa.git
```
2. install dependencies
```
cd poa-popa
npm install
```
3. deploy the contract, e.g. use Remix and Metamask
4. create file `poa-popa/web-dapp/src/contract-output.json` with the following structure:
```
    {
        "ProofOfPhysicalAddress": {
            "address": "*** CONTRACT ADDRESS, 0x... ***",
            "bytecode": "*** BYTECODE, 60606040... ***",
            "abi": [ *** ABI *** ]
        }
    }
```
5. create file `poa-popa/web-dapp/server-config-private.js` with the following content:
```
'use strict';

module.exports = function (cfg_public) {
    return {
        lob_api_key: '*** LOB TEST OR PROD API KEY ***',
        rpc: '*** PROBABLY INFURA ***',
        signer: '*** SIGNER ADDRESS, 0x... ***', // with 0x prefix
        signer_private_key: '*** SIGNER PRIVATE KEY ***', // without 0x prefix
        confirmation_page_url: '*** URL FOR CONFIRMATION PAGE, e.g. https://yourserver.com/confirm ***', // used only for postcard
        // it is recommended to install and use redis for keeping session keys
        session_store: {
            "type": "redis",
            "params": { *** REDIS CONNECTION PARAMETERS *** }
        },
    };
};
```
6. build react components
```
# in poa-popa/web-dapp
npm run build
```
7. start server
```
# in poa-popa/web-dapp
node server
```
or, still better, use pm2
```
# in poa-popa/web-dapp
pm2 start -i 0 server
```

## Description
### contract
Contract source file is `blockchain/contracts/ProofOfPhysicalAddress.sol`.
* main data structures are `User` and `PhysicalAddress`:
```
    struct PhysicalAddress
    {
        string name;

        string country;
        string state;
        string city;
        string location;
        string zip;

        uint256 creation_block;
        bytes32 confirmation_code_sha3;
        uint256 confirmation_block;
    }

    struct User
    {
        uint256 creation_block;
        PhysicalAddress[] physical_addresses;
    }

    mapping (address => User) public users;
```

`location` in contract is alias for `address` in dapp.

* there are also three variables for statistics
```
    uint64 public total_users;
    uint64 public total_addresses;
    uint64 public total_confirmed;
```

* contract has `owner` which is the account that sent the transaction to deploy the contract.

* contract has `signer` which is the account that is used to calculate signatures on server-side and validate parameters from contract-side. By default when contract is created, `signer` is set to `owner`. You can change it later with `set_signer` method.

* main methods are
```
    function register_address(
        string name,
        string country, string state, string city, string location, string zip,
        uint256 price_wei,
        bytes32 confirmation_code_sha3, uint8 sig_v, bytes32 sig_r, bytes32 sig_s)
    public payable
 ```
 used to register a new address, and
 ```
    function confirm_address(string confirmation_code_plain, uint8 sig_v, bytes32 sig_r, bytes32 sig_s)
    public
```
used to confirm an address.

* `name` may be different for each new address

* `country`, `state`, `city`, `location` and `zip` are `trim()`ed and `toLowerCase()`ed by dapp before passing them to the contract.

* when confirmation code is entered, `user_address_by_confirmation_code` method is called by dapp to search for address with matching confirmation code.

### signing parameters
First, all relevant parameters for `register_address` and `confirm_address` need to be converted from utf8 strings to hex strings and then combined together into a single long hex string and then passed to `sign()` function (defined in `web-dapp/server-lib/sign.js`), e.g.

```
    var text2sign = wallet + Buffer.from(confirmation_code_plain, 'utf8').toString('hex');
    try {
        var sign_output = sign(web3, text2sign);
```
this function produces a signature, that is divided into three parameters `v`, `r` and `s` that need to be passed to client and then by the client to contract's method.
Contract uses built-in ethereum function `ecrecover` to verify that signer's address matches contract's `signer`:
```
    function signer_is_valid(bytes32 data, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
    public constant returns (bool)
    {
        bytes memory prefix = '\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n32';
        bytes32 prefixed = keccak256(prefix, data);
        return (ecrecover(prefixed, v, r, s) == signer);
    }
```
Note the use of magical `prefix`.
